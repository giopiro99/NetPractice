# 🖧 NetPractice — 42 School

**NetPractice** is a project in the **42** curriculum designed to introduce the fundamental concepts of **networking**.
The goal is to understand how an IP network functions by correctly configuring addresses, subnets, and routes between different devices.

---

## 📘 Description

The project consists of a series of **interactive exercises** performed via a web interface provided by 42.
Each level presents a network to analyze and configure: the student must correctly assign **IP addresses**, **subnet masks**, and **gateways** to ensure communication between all nodes.

No coding is required — the focus is entirely on **network logic** and understanding the **foundations of the TCP/IP protocol**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand the functioning of **IP addresses** and **Subnet Masks**.
- Learn to calculate and configure valid subnets and IP ranges.
- Understand the concept of **gateways** and **routing**.
- Verify connectivity between devices in a network.
- Apply basic rules of **network design**.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

* **IPv4 Addressing**
* **Subnetting / CIDR**
* **Static Routing**
* **Gateways & Network Interfaces**
* **Communication flow** between Hosts, Switches, and Routers

---

## 🧩 Project Structure

The project is composed of **10 progressive levels** (exercises):
Each level introduces a new difficulty or concept, evolving into complex networks with multiple routers and distinct subnets.

---

## 🏁 Final Outcome

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
* Correctly configure simple or complex IP networks.
* Analyze connectivity issues and identify their root causes.
* Understand how devices communicate across the Internet.
